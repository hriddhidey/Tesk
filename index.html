	<h2>EXPRESS YOURSELF.</h2>
	<section>
		<p> The aim of our platform is to provide people with a portal to express 
			themselves in a distraction-free environment.
			I like to keep the focus on the stuff that matters - the content,
			and the experience of pouring your heart out.
			Our interface is disarmingly simple, yet feature-rich, with provisions for text formatting, and a
			handy voice-to-text button, allowing you to go handsfree, so you can capture your thoughts anytime,
			anywhere. <br />
			So what are you waiting for? Get started!
